It lacked consistency from start to finish.,2
Some claims didn’t feel fully supported.,2
The writing felt rushed and under-edited.,2
Would’ve liked to see more reflection.,2
Felt like a response made in the heat of the moment.,2
"A few good insights, but lost in the delivery.",2
Could’ve used a clearer thesis.,2
It offered more complaints than constructive input.,2
